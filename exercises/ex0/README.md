### Overview

Welcome to your guide to application development on the SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP). This is the introduction followed by comprehensive tutorials that will guide you through the process of developing and deploying a full-stack application based on the [SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP)](https://pages.github.tools.sap/cap/docs/) and [SAP Fiori elements](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/sdk/#/topic/03265b0408e2432c9571d6b3feb6b1fd) on [SAP BTP](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-explore-cloud-platform.html). With these tutorials, you'll leverage a variety of different tools and services, learning each of them step by step. Whether you're new to SAP BTP or an experienced developer, the following tutorials are designed to help you hit the ground running.

This guidance covers a variety of topics starting from developing a basic CAP application to integration to SAP S/4HANA Cloud.

### SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP)

CAP is a framework of languages, libraries, and tools for building enterprise-grade services and applications. It guides developers along a 'golden path' of proven best practices and a great wealth of out-of-the-box solutions to recurring tasks.

Instead of delving into overly-technical disciplines, CAP lets you focus on your domain. This accelerates the development process and safeguards investments in a world of rapidly changing cloud technologies.

The CAP framework features a mix of proven and broadly-adopted open-source and SAP technologies, as highlighted in the following figure.

On top of open-source technologies, CAP adds:

- Core Data Services (CDS) as a universal modeling language for both domain models and service definitions.

- A Service SDK and runtime for Node.js and Java, offering libraries to implement and consume services as well as optimized generic provider implementations, which are capable of automatically serving many requests.

### SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP)

SAP BTP is an open set of Software, Platform, and Infrastructure as a Service system that delivers in-memory capabilities, core platform services, and unique micro-services for building and extending intelligent, mobile, and browser-enabled applications. SAP BTP is multilingual, with support for most major languages and support for development, testing, and production systems both inside an organization and to the larger public.

SAP BTP is also constantly evolving. SAP continuously updates the services it provides, the platforms that run the custom code, and the infrastructure that supports everything. This allows developers to focus on the custom code, and not to worry about hardware maintenance or software upgrades. SAP BTP offers you the ability to turn data into business value, compose end-to-end business processes, and build and extend SAP solutions and applications quickly.

The central point of entry to the platform is the SAP BTP cockpit, where you can access your accounts and applications and manage all activities associated with them.

### SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry Runtime

The structure of the account in SAP BTP provides a flexible and scalable way to organize and manage resources. Open-source cloud computing platforms like Cloud Foundry offer developers a way to deploy and manage cloud applications with ease. These tutorials provide instructions for deploying your CAP application to SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry runtime.

### Using Free Service Plans

All services needed for the execution of the tutorials are part of the free tier model for SAP BTP. The free tier model lets you try out services in global accounts without any additional cost using the consumption-based commercial model and an [enterprise account](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/enterprise-accounts).

The free tier model includes free service plans limited in scope and capacity for many services within SAP BTP. To learn more about and how to access free service plans, see [Using Free Service Plans](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/using-free-service-plans).
